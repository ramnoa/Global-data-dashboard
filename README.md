# 📚 Global Library Dashboard

This Tableau dashboard presents an overview of the number of libraries across different global regions using Data that was provided by IBM . It is part of my Data Science & Machine Learning portfolio to demonstrate data visualization and analytical storytelling skills.

## 🧩 Project Description

- Objective: Visualize and compare the distribution of libraries across global regions.
- Tool Used: Tableau
- Data Source:
              This dataset was provided by IBM as part of a data analytics and visualization challenge.  
              It contains global statistics on libraries, including total counts, volumes, users, and expenditures across various countries and regions.
